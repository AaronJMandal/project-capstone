# Spirits and Such Consultation

Welcome! This is my interpretation of SaSC website from the anime tv series Mob Psycho 100. This site provides psychic related services and designed to be somewhat shady. This site is merely for practice and a love letter to the source material.

## Web Design

The reference sites I found have captured the essence of this project. Drawing inspiration from them, I’ve added my own features to enhance the site’s purpose.

- Following Japanese UI where it provides tons of detail, almost too much detail.
- Exaggerating the colors and motion gives the site a playful yet slightly shady vibe.

## Skills used for this project

- Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, Javascript and React
- Backend Development: Node.js and Express.js
- Login/Signup Development: Auth0
- Database Management: MongoDB
